### Climate Data Analysis (INTERIM VERSION) - Boulder Colorado
#### This graph shows NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network daily climate data as an annual average temperature for Boulder Colorado obtained from the ESIIL Learning Portal for Station <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USC00050848/detail">USC0005048</a>. That station has a precipitation and temperature data coverage of 97% with Start Date of 1893-10-01, and the extract from the learning portal includes data through 2023-09-30

#### Increasing annual average temperature trend in Boulder Colorado
##### Given most daily data from Boulder Colorado Station USC0005048 of NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network between January 1901 and September 2023, there is an average increase of +0.0181 °C per year based upon calculation of average mean temperature using a linear ordinary least squares analysis of the temperature trend (shown in red on the chart).  Mean temperature was 11.41°C in 1901 and 13.60 in 2022 (last full year of data in set)

##### There is discontinuity of data in the set for temperatures
* No temperature values until 1902
* No values from 07/01/1937 through 12/31/1940  
* 1994 is also missing a lot of data 
##### Temperature is converted from Fahrenheit in the dataset to Celsius in the graph.  The graph is interactive.
